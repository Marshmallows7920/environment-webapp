Grains are primarily pollinated by the wind, but fruits, nuts and vegetables are pollinated by bees. Seventy out of the top 100 human food crops — which supply about 90 percent of the world’s nutrition — are pollinated by bees."

Nearly three billion terrestrial vertebrates alone – the vast majority being reptiles – were affected and some endangered species were believed to be driven to extinction. At its peak, air quality dropped to hazardous levels in all southern and eastern states."

A significant addition of sulfur dioxide(from the explosion) into the atmosphere could cause a short-term global cooling effect by reflecting solar radiation. In addition to that, Volcanic eruptions of this size and scope can affect global climate by reducing tropospheric temperatures, decreasing the amount of solar radiation hitting Earth’s surface, and altering circulation patterns in the atmosphere"
